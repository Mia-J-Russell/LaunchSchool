1) 10.times {|number| puts (" " * number) + "The Flintstones Rock!"}

2) puts "the value of 40 + 2 is #{40 + 2}"
  puts "the value of 40 + 2 is" (40 + 2).to_s

3) while divisor > 0 do
     factors << number / divisor if number % divisor == 0
     divisor -= 1
   end
  checks if remainder is 0 after the division
  returns factors

4) the first method changes buffer
  the second buffer does not

5) the problem is because limit isn't in the method
  def fib(first_num, second_num, limits)

  result = fib(0, 1, limit)

6) 34

7) yes.
