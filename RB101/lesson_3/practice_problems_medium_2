2)

3) my_string = "pumpkins" (+= creates a new string object)
  my_array = ["pumpkins", "rutabaga"] (adds the element to the array)

4) my_string = "pumpkinsrutabaga"
  my_array = ["pumpkins"]

5) We could rename the method so it's

  maybe to def add_rutabaga
  (or the way that's shown, making the
  method non destructive and assigning it to a new variable)

6) def color_valid(color)
    color == "blue" || color == "green"
   end
